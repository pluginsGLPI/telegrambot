Branch created with the intention of functioning as an introduction web site of the project, a small point of entry where anyone can find out what it is about and to be able to get relevant information.

Here you can find code examples and generated files, detailed information about the project, an installation guide, screen captures, a blog with the latest news and links to the documentation and contact information.
